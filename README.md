## Description

These are some PCB adapters for SOP-16, SSOP-16, SSOP-20, and QFN-32. They are intended for a few interesting ICs (SSI2130, SSI2144, etc.) from Sound Semiconductor that I would like to breadboard. But they may of course work for any other ICs. The "pin-out" of the adapters is .6" (15.24mm) wide DIP. This is the wider dual inline package which was common in older computers (Z80 or 6502 CPUs or even still current PIC18F4550) for example. The SSOPs and QFNs can almost for sure fit the more common .3" (7.62mm) narrower DIP, but I didn't bother! Both ready to use gerbers and complete Kicad project archives are available. Have fun :)

## Revision history and status

* **_Version 1.0_** Uploaded everything on github, need to send the gerbers to fabrication and give them a try.
